Installation Guide
------------------
This document is provided for Linux users. See also the ModusToolbox™ tools package installation guide included with the installation of the tools.


System Requirements
-------------------
The ModusToolbox™ software consumes approximately 2 GB of disk space. Like most modern software, it requires both free disk space and memory to run effectively. We recommend a system configuration with a PassMark CPU score > 2000 (cpubenchmark.net), at least 25 GB of free disk space, and 8 GB of RAM. The product will operate with fewer resources; however, performance may be degraded.

ModusToolbox™ software is supported on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS, and 22.04 LTS. It is not supported on 32-bit operating systems.

ModusToolbox™ software requires the following programs to work properly. Many of these programs may not be installed on your Ubuntu system:
 * diffutils
 * git
 * make
 * coreutils
 * perl
 * python3
 * libxcb-xinerama0

Run the following command to install these packages, as applicable:
	$ sudo apt install diffutils git make coreutils perl python3 libxcb-xinerama0

If you intend to use "secure" devices, refer to this README.md file on GitHub for more details: https://github.com/Infineon/cysecuretools/blob/master/README.md.


Download
--------
The ModusToolbox™ tools package is available from the Infineon Developer Center website (https:// softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.modustoolbox) to download and/or install. Select the Linux (Ubunbtu) package:
 * Linux: ModusToolbox_3.1.0.<build>-linux-install.tar.gz 

Note:	For a Linux install, we recommend using the Download option.


Installation
------------
There are several ways to extract the ModusToolbox_3.1.0.<build>-linux-install.tar.gz file; ensure that the end result looks like this:
	/home/<user>/ModusToolbox/
 
If the files/folders were extracted into a different location, move them to /home/<user>/ModusToolbox. 
 
Note:	The Launcher tool currently extracts the files into /home/<user>/.local/share/Infineon_Technologies_AG/Infineon-Toolbox/Tools/ModusToolbox_<version>-linux-install/ModusToolbox/.

If you need to install ModusToolbox in a non-default location, you must set the CY_TOOLS_PATHS environment variable for your system to point to the ModusToolbox/tools_3.1 folder, or set that variable in each Makefile.

After extracting, you must run the following scripts before running ModusToolbox™ software on your machine:
 * OpenOCD: /home/<user>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.1/openocd/udev_rules/install_rules.sh 
 * AIROC™ Bluetooth® Boards: /home/<user>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.1/driver_media/install_rules.sh 
 * Firmware Loader: /home/<user>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.1/fw-loader/udev_rules/install_rules.sh 
 * Post-Install Script: /home/<user>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.1/modus-shell/postinstall 
 * IDC Registration Script: /home/<user>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.1/idc_registration-3.1.0.bash 


Device Access
-------------
On common Linux distributions, the serial UART ports (usually /dev/ttySx or /dev/ttyUSBx devices) belong to the 
root user and to the dialout or plugdev groups. Standard users are not allowed to access these devices.

An easy way to allow the current user access to the Linux machine's serial ports is by adding the user to the 
dialout and plugdev groups. This can be done using the following command:

     $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout,plugdev $USER

Note: For this command to take effect, you must log out and then log back in.
