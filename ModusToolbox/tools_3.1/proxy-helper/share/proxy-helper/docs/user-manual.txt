======================================================================
The proxy-helper tool simplifies managing proxy server
settings for ModusToolbox users. The tool uses both the
traditional environment variables (http_proxy and https_proxy) and
user-based settings that are stored specifically for the proxy-helper tool.

The proxy-helper is a command line tool. It supports the following
command line options and arguments:

Options:
  -?, -h, --help           Displays this help.
  -v, --version            Displays version information.
  -l, --lookup <url>       Lookup the proxy settings for a url.
  -e, --exec <command>     Set the proxy environment then run the
      	     		   given command. 
  -c, --config <list|set>  Manage the proxy settings.

======================================================================
Commands and options

The following sections describe each of the proxy-helper tool commands:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
-c, --config

The "config" options have two sub-commands that allow you to list
and set the settings for the proxy-helper tool. 

The "list" sub-command lists the settings. For example:

> proxy-helper --config list
mode: manual
proxy: myproxy.company.com

The "set" sub-command allows you to set one of the settings. The
setting and new value are specifed as name=value. The value can be an
empty string. Each invocation of the tool only sets one value. For
example:

> proxy-helper --config set mode=manual
> proxy-helper --config set proxy=myproxy.company.com
> proxy-helper --config set proxy=

----------------------------------------------------------------------
-l, --lookup

The "lookup" option takes a <url> argument. This function prints (to
stdout) the relevant proxy server to use when accessing the provided
url. This command is used when another tool needs to
find the appropriate proxy server. For example, the project-creator
and library-manager tools call "proxy-helper --lookup <manifest url>"
to discover the proxy server to use when accessing the manifest files
via http(s) connections.

The "lookup" function first checks the calling environment. If the
http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables are already set,
those values are returned. If not, proxy-helper checks your 
settings. If the mode is "manual", the proxy-helper uses those proxy
settings. If the mode is "direct", the
proxy-helper uses an empty string as the proxy server address.

If there is a conflict between the environment variables and the
proxy-helper settings, the tool prints a warning message to make it 
clear which value is being used and how to change it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
-e, --exec

The "exec" option runs the provided command (including command line
arguments for that command) after setting the http_proxy and
https_proxy environment variables to the correct settings. The "exec"
option uses the "lookup" function to find the proxy server.

If the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables are already
set, they stay set.

The exit code from running the command is returned as the exit
code from proxy-helper.

======================================================================
Settings

The proxy-helper tools maintain two settings: mode and proxy. 

The mode setting has the value of "manual" or "direct". In "direct" mode, the
proxy-helper tool makes no change to the environment. In "manual"
mode, the proxy-helper tool uses the value of the proxy setting. 

The proxy setting includes the server and port to use as a proxy server. The
format is servername:port. For example:

myproxy.company.com:8888

Both the project-creator and library-manager tools have a GUI for
changing the settings. In addition, the command line option --config
can be used to change the settings.
