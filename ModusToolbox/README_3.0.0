Installation Guide
------------------
This document is provided for Linux users. See also the ModusToolbox™ tools package installation guide included with the installation of the tools.


System Requirements
-------------------
The ModusToolbox™ software consumes approximately 2 GB of disk space. Like most modern software, it requires both free disk space and memory to run effectively. We recommend a system configuration with a PassMark CPU score > 2000 (cpubenchmark.net), at least 25 GB of free disk space, and 8 GB of RAM. The product will operate with fewer resources; however, performance may be degraded.

ModusToolbox™ software is supported on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS (recommended). It is not supported on 32-bit operating systems.

Note: For Linux, ModusToolbox™ software requires the following Unix programs (with minimum versions) to work properly:
•	cmp (v2.8.1)
•	git (2.17.0)
•	make (v3.81)
•	mktemp (v8.25)
•	perl (v5.18.2)
•	python (v3.7)
•	cysecuretools (v3.10) – Refer to the "Secure Boot" SDK User Guide for more details (https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-software).

Some versions of Ubuntu Linux do not include 'make' by default. Use the following command to install it:
    $ sudo apt-get install make


Installation
------------
Extract the ModusToolbox_3.0.0.<build>-linux-install.tar.gz file to your <user_home> directory. The extraction
process will create a "ModusToolbox" directory there, if it doesn't exist. 

Note: If you install ModusToolbox in a non-default location, you will need to set the CY_TOOLS_PATHS environment
variable for your system to point to the ModusToolbox/tools_3.0 folder, or set that variable in each Makefile.

After extracting, you must run the following scripts before running ModusToolbox™ software on your machine:
 * OpenOCD: <user_home>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/openocd/udev_rules/install_rules.sh 
 * AIROC™ Bluetooth Boards: <user_home>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/driver_media/install_rules.sh 
 * Firmware Loader: <user_home>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/fw-loader/udev_rules/install_rules.sh 
 * Post-Install Script: <user_home>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/modus-shell/postinstall
 * IDC Registration Script: <user_home>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/idc_registration-3.0.0.bash

On Ubuntu systems, you must install additional packages using the following command:
    $ sudo apt install libncurses5 libusb-1.0-0 libxcb-xinerama0

Device Access
-------------
On common Linux distributions, the serial UART ports (usually /dev/ttySx or /dev/ttyUSBx devices) belong to the 
root user and to the dialout or plugdev groups. Standard users are not allowed to access these devices.

An easy way to allow the current user access to the Linux machine's serial ports is by adding the user to the 
dialout and plugdev groups. This can be done using the following command:

     $sudo usermod -a -G dialout,plugdev $USER

Note: For this command to take effect, you must log out and then log back in.
